# Ant Colony
## Overview
Foraging ants simulation, implemented in [Processing](https://processing.org/).

- Ants seek bait.
- Every 2 bait returned to the anthill = new ant.
- 30% of new ants have wings.
- Ants have a fixed lifespan.
- Deceased ants decay and are eventually removed from the system.
- Bait is added periodically.
- Click to add bait.
- Ants avoid contact with members of opposing colonies.

## Usage
1. Launch the Processing IDE.
2. Open ant_colony.pde
3. Press the "run" button.

## History
I've spent most of my career trying to ignore JavaScript.  Sadly, it has become obvious 
JavaScript isn't going away.  Quite the opposite, it has become a foundational component of the web UI stack.
In an effort to boost my JavaScript skills, in 2015 I completed a couple of JavaScript programming 
courses offered by 
[Kahn Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org).  These classes taught JavaScript programming via 
exercises using the [Processing](https://processing.org/) visualization framework.
This is a 2017 native Processing port of my capstone project for the
[Advanced JS: Natural Simulations](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-natural-simulations)
course.
